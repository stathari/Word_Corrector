For our model, it is more dependent on recall as it shall correct the data that are actually needs to be corrected.

1. On corrupting the data by 10% 
Achieved the results:
recall =  17.8137651822
precision =  86.2745098039


2. On corrupting the data by 20%
Achieved the results:
recall =  12.8309572301
precision =  82.8947368421


On corrupting the data with 10% the recall has improved by 4% on average.
